"""
A module that runs the Superdesk public API.

The API is built using the `Eve framework <http://python-eve.org/>`_ and is
thus essentially just a normal `Flask <http://flask.pocoo.org/>`_ application.

.. note:: The public API should not be confused with the "internal" API that
    is meant to be used by the Superdesk browser client only.
