Headline: Senden defends but Scott favourite

Abstract: John Senden defends his Valspar Championship this week but countr=
yman Adam Scott is getting the headlines.

Gol PGA
By Ben Everill

LOS ANGELES, March 10 AAP =96 Adam Scott is hoping to live up to his favour=
ite tag as he searches for more competitive reps in his Masters preparation=
s.
Scott lines up this week at Innisbrook Resort=92s Cooperhead course in Tamp=
a as a short price favourite on the US PGA tour while countryman John Sende=
n defends the title he won spectacularly last year.
Scott, now world No.4 after a tie for fourth at the World Golf Championship=
s Cadillac Championship last week in his return after a two-and-a-half mont=
h layoff, is looking to reclaim the competitive edge he lost during his bre=
ak.
With his usual sublime shot making hardly missing a beat and his change to =
a short putter for the first time in four years actually improving his putt=
ing statistics the Queenslander says it=92s now all about getting his game =
=91back nine Sunday=92 ready.
The 2013 Masters champion wants to head to Magnolia Lane in a month confide=
nt his game can compete under the gun.
=93I think it's a good little stretch for me to challenge myself into a bit=
 of form into Augusta,=94 Scott said as he also expects to play next week a=
t the Arnold Palmer Invitational and, depending on how well he goes the fol=
lowing week=92s Texas Open.
=93I need to play. I need to be in that competitive form and last week was =
a good chance but maybe lack of competition just didn't get me over the lin=
e on the back nine.
=93This week I'm going to have to stay patient, it's a little tighter golf =
course and I=92ll just really have to rein it in and challenge the swing a =
little bit.
=93The next few weeks are about getting a bit of form going and hopefully b=
e good for Augusta.=94
Senden, who claimed his second career win a year ago, almost eight years af=
ter the first, is quietly confident of a repeat effort.
He has two runner-up finishes and the victory in his career at Innisbrook a=
nd can also draw on the fact it was his short game, including a chip in on =
the 16th on Sunday, that helped him seal the deal.
=93It is exciting turning up and knowing I can get it done. I love the golf=
 course, it is challenging and it asks you to bring your best, so I=92m exc=
ited to be able to play knowing I don=92t need to fear it,=94 Senden said.
=93It came down to believing in my short game and that belief helped me to =
a career year. A lot of years I had been playing over here and striking it =
so well but not getting enough from my game but I finally realised to switc=
h on the belief across my game and know I can beat these guys
=93For it to happen really solidified my thinking.=94
While his tie for 31st at the WGC event last week might not look great on p=
aper the reality is just one hole at Trump Doral derailed an otherwise impr=
essive week.
Senden was nine-over on the par three ninth in his four rounds but six unde=
r on the remaining holes.
Robert Allenby, Steven Bowditch, Marc Leishman, Greg Chalmers and Rod Pampl=
ing are also in the field.
