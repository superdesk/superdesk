Lee.</p><p>   The founding Lee family has been under growing state pressure to <br />unravel its complex cross shareholdings and make its governing <br />structure more transparent.</p><p>   The sell-off announced on Wednesday indicates a desire to <br />streamline the behemoth so as to concentrate on its key <br />profit-making units, said Kim Ji-san, analyst at Seoul-based Kium <br />Securities said.</p><p>   "The deal shows Samsung is determined to shed non-core units <br />deemed not competitive enough globally and to focus on key <br />businesses like electronics, finances, construction and <br />engineering," Kim said.</p><p>   Samsung Techwin, a developer of security equipment and aerospace <br />technologies, reported a net profit of 133 billion won (about <br />$A140.7 million) last year, but has amassed a net loss of 14.5 <br />billion for the first three quarter of this year.</p><p>   Samsung's restructuring has not always been smooth sailing.</p><p>   Last week it had to scrap a merger between two major units - <br />Samsung Heavy Industries and Samsung Engineering - because of the <br />spiralling cost of buying back stock from shareholders opposed to <br />the deal.</p><p>   AFP sn</p></body.content></body></nitf>
